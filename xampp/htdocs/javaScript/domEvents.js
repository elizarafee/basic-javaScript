/* DOM Events :
Everything that happens in the browser is registered as event
The formula for building JS functionality around events is called eventf handling
It takes this form :
1st : identifhy the DOM node the interactive behaviour we'll be at attached to (a call to action button)
2nd : identify the event you want to detect (click and bind that to DOM node)
3rd : create a function that is triggered when the event fires (a mobile window pops up to cover the screen)
some typical DOM events : 
Browser level events (load, window, resize, etc)
DOM level events : content interaction (click, focus, submit, etc)
Common browser level events : Load, error, online/ofline, resize, scroll
Other events : media events, progress events, CSS transition events
for more MDN: event reference
